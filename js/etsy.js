Each and every item we create is done so with our own two hands. (Jason + Heather) Each product in our shop takes a bare minimum of 5 hours to craft from start to finish over a period of several days, which may involve one or all of the following steps: cutting, sanding, filling, affixing, gluing, more sanding, cleaning, painting, curing, drying, finishing, and finally packaging. Since our items are handmade, each one is as unique as the next and we feel that this contributes to the overall handmade experience here on Etsy.

Simply take your PDF file to your local copy shop and have them print your decorations on the paper of your choice. We find that a smooth card stock with a matte finish looks the best. Most copy shops will be able to do this type of print job for you for minimal cost. Some even offer online services to send them your file and pick it up at their location. Some of our files are designed to print on 11x17 INCH TABLOID SIZED SHEETS OF PAPER. *** Please note that if you attempt to print these on 8 \u00bd x 11 inch paper, the result will look \u201csmaller\u201d as the images are re-sized to fit the smaller paper size ***\r\n\r\nEDITING:\r\n\r\nWe include one round of editing changes with each order.
